> Note: This is a work in progress. Do not use it for any project except contributing to the development of this repository.

A native Swift API for OpenCL, based on he [C++ bindings](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenCL-CLHPP). SwiftOpenCL runs on every platform that supports OpenCL - Linux, Windows, macOS, and Android. It currently supports up to OpenCL 1.2, with more functionality planned for the future.

## Tips

`CLError` produces a name collision with Appleâ€™s CoreLocation, but you can just use `CoreLocation.CLError` and `SwiftOpenCL.CLError` explicitly.
